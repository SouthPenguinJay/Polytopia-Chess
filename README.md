## Setting up the server

  1. Install Postgres, if you haven't already
  2. Create a new Postgres role, eg. `polychess`.
  3. Create a database for the role, eg. `polychess`.
  4. Make a file called `server/config.json`, like so:
     ```json
     {
         "db_name": "polychess",
         "db_user": "polychess",
         "db_password": "******"
     }
     ```
